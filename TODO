INTERNAL
-   Generalize the handling of subcommands
-   Split commands and events into different metaclasses
    commands are actions performed in response to a user command, while events are
    non-callable and just react to certain events, eg.: Startup.
-   Threading needs a workover... sometimes it seems two individual threads respong to the same command
    For now it is disabled in the dispatch
-   Reload lib code also
-   Flooding... handle flooding, and implement a @more command for next message
-   Why does nohup ./nobot -c config/default.py -vvvv > data/default.log 2>&1 &
    spawn two processes
-   Get rid of __init__.py
-   unlock command triggers the locked message, even though it works
-   Add a registration facility, so that we can have the possibility of only responding to
    ppl who are authed with it
-   Somehow magically be able to parse a message like t#123 or t#311 (ie. two commands in one message)
-   Filter out deprecated functions from xelerus func list
-   When a user is repeatedly spamming commands, inform him that he should use a query window?
-   Func search, remove any non, word chars from end of search term (such as ?)
-   Add access control for Facts module and sub-commands
-   Test: are we actually being authed properly?
-   Generate html with anchors for all the terms
-   Have cross referenced terms using hte {term} syntax in a fact
-   Functions with exact matches still return all other mathces (see shpOrder, or sysFindObject)
-   looking for facts (eg `pi') -> will return `pie', even if `pi' exists
