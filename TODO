INTERNAL
-   Generalize the handling of subcommands
-   Split commands and events into different metaclasses
    commands are actions performed in response to a user command, while events are
    non-callable and just react to certain events, eg.: Startup.
-   Threading needs a workover... sometimes it seems two individual threads respong to the same command
    For now it is disabled in the dispatch
-   Reload lib code also
-   Flooding... handle flooding, and implement a @more command for next message
-   Why does nohup ./nobot -c config/default.py -vvvv > data/default.log 2>&1 &
    spawn two processes
-   Get rid of __init__.py
-   unlock command triggers the locked message, even though it works
